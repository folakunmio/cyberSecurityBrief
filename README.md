# cyberSecurityBrief by Folakunmi
A brief of my cyber security learning and tasks as I grow.

#Introduction
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio — a curated collection of hands-on labs, research, and projects that reflect my journey into the world of ethical hacking, network defense, and digital forensics. This repository serves as both a personal archive and a public showcase of my evolving skills in cybersecurity.

#📌 About Me
I'm Folakunmi, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and secure system design. My journey began with foundational training in CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) and has grown into a deeper exploration of threat modeling, penetration testing, and incident response.

🎯 Purpose of This Portfolio
This portfolio documents my growth in cybersecurity through:

Practical Labs: Real-world simulations using virtual machines and tools like Wireshark, Nessus, and OWASP ZAP.

Projects: Custom-built environments for testing exploits, securing networks, and analyzing malware.

Write-ups: Reflections and walkthroughs of challenges, CTFs, and vulnerabilities.

Certifications & Training: Progress through CEH modules and other learning paths.

#🧪 Lab Environments
Built using VMware Workstation and configured with:

Windows Server 2019 & 2022

Windows 11 Enterprise

Parrot Security OS

Ubuntu 22.04

Android VM

Each environment is isolated and tailored for specific attack simulations, vulnerability scans, and service hardening.

#🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Here are some of the tools I’ve worked with:

Category	Tools Used
Network Analysis	Wireshark, Nmap, SNMP, FTP, SMB
Vulnerability Scanning	Nessus, OWASP ZAP, Maltego
Web Security	DVWA, WordPress, WAMP, SQL Server
System Configuration	Active Directory, LDAP, SMTP, IIS
Scripting & Automation	PowerShell, Bash, Python (basic)
#📚 Featured Projects
GoodShopping & MovieScope Web Apps: Vulnerable web applications configured for testing SQLi, XSS, and authentication flaws.

Active Directory Lab: User account creation, group policy enforcement, and privilege escalation testing.

Wireshark Deep Dive: Packet capture and analysis of simulated attacks.

Nessus Vulnerability Reports: Scans of Windows and Linux VMs with remediation strategies.

#🧠 What I’ve Learned
How to set up and secure multi-OS lab environments

Fundamentals of penetration testing and ethical hacking

Importance of network segmentation and firewall configuration

Real-world implications of misconfigured services and weak credentials

#🚀 Next Steps
Expand into cloud security (Azure/AWS)

Explore threat hunting and SIEM tools

Participate in more Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions

Pursue certifications like CompTIA Security+, OSCP, and CISSP
